## 🔌 How to Integrate a WooCommerce Store

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Integration**, select the store, and optionally generate a new API key or enter your own
3. Copy the **Webhook URL** shown after creation (e.g. `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/woocommerce/<uuid>`)
4. In your WooCommerce admin panel, go to **WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → Webhooks**
5. Click **Add Webhook**:
   - **Name**: `Ecozed Sync`
   - **Status**: `Active`
   - **Topic**: `Order updated` (or any event you want to listen to)
   - **Delivery URL**: Paste the Webhook URL from step 3, and **append `?key=YOUR_API_KEY`** to the end
   - **Secret**: Leave empty (authentication is handled via the API key in the URL)
6. Click **Save Webhook**

> Orders with status `processing` will be automatically imported into Ecozed.

## 🚚 How to Integrate Ecotrack Shipping

1. Go to **Settings → Shipping Provider** in the dashboard
2. Click **Add Provider** and fill in:
   - **Company**: `ecotrack`
   - **Store**: Select the store (or leave empty for global/all stores)
   - **Prefix**: Your Ecotrack client prefix (e.g. `world-express`)
   - **API Key**: Your Ecotrack API token (Bearer token)
   - **Base URL**: Leave empty to auto-generate (`https://<prefix>.ecotrack.dz`)
3. Click **Save** — the provider will appear in the shipping section
4. Then go to **Settings → Shipping** and seed default wilaya costs via the **Load Template** button
5. Go to **Settings → Stop Desk** inside the provider card and click **Sync** to load stop-desk communes

Once set up, you can:
- Send orders to Ecotrack from the Orders page
- Validate/dispatch orders
- Print shipping labels and bordereaux (PDF)
- Sync delivery tracking status

> Toggle the provider on/off with the power button — no need to delete it when temporarily unused.

## ⚠️ Important: Backup Before Updating

Before updating your Ecozed instance to a newer version, **always export a backup** of your database first.

Ecozed has a **built-in backup system** located in **Settings → Data Backup & Restore**. Export a backup file before upgrading — if anything goes wrong or data is lost, you can simply re-import it.

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: 100% Free — Deploy on Vercel (Recommended)

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) offers a generous free tier perfect for this project.

### Option 2: Your Own Server (with Docker)

Use the included `Dockerfile` for a containerized deployment on any VPS or dedicated server.

### Option 3: Google Cloud Run

Deploy as a serverless container on Google Cloud Run for auto-scaling and pay-per-use pricing.

## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create a Database

Create a free PostgreSQL database on **[Neon DB](https://neon.tech/)** (their free tier is excellent):

1. Sign up at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/)
2. Create a new project (Neon auto-creates a default database named `neondb`)
3. **Create a new database** named `zaidi_ecom_dev`:
   - Go to the **Databases** tab in your Neon project dashboard
   - Click **Add Database** → name it `zaidi_ecom_dev`
4. Copy your connection string (looks like `postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/zaidi_ecom_dev`)

> ⚠️ **Don't use the default `neondb` database** — create a dedicated `zaidi_ecom_dev` database for this project to avoid conflicts.

### Step 2: Fork the Repository

Fork this repo on GitHub to your account.

### Step 3: Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **Add New → Project**
3. Select your forked repository
4. In **Environment Variables**, add:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your Neon DB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Any secure random string (e.g. generated via `openssl rand -base64 32`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |

5. Click **Deploy**

### Step 4: Create Admin Account (Automatic)

Once deployed, navigate to your Vercel URL. The first visit will automatically redirect to a **Setup Wizard** where you create the admin account. No scripts or CLI commands needed — just fill in the form.

After creating the admin account, you'll be redirected to the login page. Log in and start managing your business!

> **Note:** The setup page only appears when no admin account exists. After the first admin is created, it is no longer accessible.

---

### Docker Deployment (Alternative)

```bash
docker build -t ecozed .
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="your-neon-connection-string" \
  -e JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key" \
  -e NODE_ENV="production" \
  ecozed
```

### Google Cloud Run (Alternative)

```bash
# Build and push to Google Container Registry
docker build -t gcr.io/your-project/ecozed .
docker push gcr.io/your-project/ecozed

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy ecozed \
  --image gcr.io/your-project/ecozed \
  --set-env-vars "DATABASE_URL=...,JWT_SECRET=...,NODE_ENV=production" \
  --platform managed
```
